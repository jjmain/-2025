Quantum Algorithms: Quantum Phase Estimation
Background
Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a fundamental quantum algorithm that
estimates the eigenvalue (or phase) corresponding to an eigenvector of a
given unitary operator. It plays a crucial role in various quantum
applications, including Shor's factoring algorithm, quantum simulations, and
quantum chemistry. QPE encodes phase information into a quantum
register using controlled unitary operations and extracts it through the
inverse quantum Fourier transform. Although the algorithm is conceptually
straightforward, its practical implementation requires translating the
mathematical descriptions of the unitary operator and input state into
executable quantum circuits, which is often a challenging task in practice.

1. QPE Implementation
Given the unitary operator U = [[1 0]
                                [0 e^{2œÄiŒ∏}]] and the eigenvector v‚ÇÅ = [0 1]·µÄ,
implement the QPE algorithm to estimate the phase Œ∏ in the following cases:
  1.1. Œ∏ = 5/8
  1.2. Œ∏ = 3/7
For each case, analyze how increasing the number of qubits used for the
estimation affects the precision of the output.

2. Finding Eigenvalues of a Matrix using QPE
Given the matrix
        [1 0 8 1]
M  =    [0 1 1 8],
        [8 1 1 0]
        [1 8 0 1]
estimate all eigenvalues of M using only the QPE algorithm. You are not
allowed to use classical methods to compute eigenvectors in advance.
Note 1: Your algorithm should be designed to handle the case where the
matrix is not positive definite.
Note 2: The spectral norm can be upper bounded using either the 1-norm
or the ‚àû-norm.
Note 3: While you may use built-in functions to simulate matrix
exponential, higher scores will be awarded for implementations that
explicitly decompose M into quantum operators and manually construct the
corresponding circuit.
Note 4: You are encouraged to estimate the eigenvalues without relying on
prior knowledge of the eigenvectors. If not, your submission may receive a
lower score.

3. Analyzing the Impact of Noise on QPE
QPE is known to be sensitive to various types of quantum noise. Using
your implementation from the previous problems, apply different noise
models (e.g., depolarizing noise, readout error) and analyze how the
accuracy of QPE is affected.

4. Exploring Applications of QPE
Identify an application where the QPE algorithm can be applied effectively.
Construct a simple example that demonstrates the use of QPE in that
application, and explain how the algorithm contributes to solving the
problem.
